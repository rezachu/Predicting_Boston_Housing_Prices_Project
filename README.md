# Predicting Boston Housing Prices

## Overview
This is the first official project of the Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree, and the course is co-created with Kaggle. In this project, we are going to build a simple machine learning model to predict the Boston Housing Price. The objective is to learn about the basic concepts of machine learning and have a simple implementation on it.


## Software requirement

- [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [iPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

## Documents included in the repository

- `README.md`
- `housing.csv`
- `boston_housing.html`
- `boston_housing.ipynb`
- `visuals.py`

### Memo to Python beginner
In case you are new to Python and you do not know how to create an environment and install the package, here are few links that could help.
- [Managing Python](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/py2or3.html)
- [Managing Environments](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/using/envs.html)
- [Create Virtual Environments for Python with Conda](https://uoa-eresearch.github.io/eresearch-cookbook/recipe/2014/11/20/conda/)

## Run 
1. Start your the terminal or command line
2. Activate your environment
3. Navigate to the root directory of this repository (./Predicting_Boston_Housing_Prices_Project/)
4. Run `jupyter notebook boston_housing.ipynb`

Then the web browser would open the jupyter notebook.

Data

The modified Boston housing dataset consists of 490 data points, with each datapoint having 3 features. This dataset is a modified version of the Boston Housing dataset found on the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing).

Features 1. `RM`: average number of rooms per dwelling 2. `LSTAT`: percentage of population considered lower status 3. `PTRATIO`: pupil-student ratio by town

Target Variable 4. `MDEV`: median value of owner-occupied homes
